# Dev Build
This is the place where pre-release builds will be placed. It follows the same method of compiling that the stable build does.

## Features
``v0.4 pre-release``

A feature included in this particular build entails ``greater rift completion time estimations``. It hasn't been fully calculated and tested for errors; the ouput provides some statistics like TTK (time to kill) the averaged minio, and the ``health scaling of each GR level``.

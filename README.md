# Installation/Compiling
If whoever looking is not trusting of this particular program, there is a way to compile it manually. Microsoft has included a CS compiler in the .NET Framework 4.0 directory. In this case, it takes a fairly simply .bat or .cmd file to automate compiling it. The file in question is also included. It will take the .cs file and output an .exe file.

To further investigate, the .cs file can be viewed to examine it for anything whoever might be undesirable.

This is only mentioned with possibility that not all programs are well-intentioned. Also, since it's such a small program, it could lead to questions of its safety.
